Customer Segmentation & Predictive Modeling

To help businesses better understand customer behavior and personalize marketing strategies, I developed a clustering and classification pipeline using real customer data.

ðŸ”¹ Clustering & Segmentation

Applied K-Means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction.

Evaluated models using the Silhouette Score â€” K-Means performed best (0.51) compared to Agglomerative (0.48) and DBSCAN (0.38).

Identified distinct customer groups based on demographics, income levels, and product spending patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Predictive Modeling with SVM

Used K-Means cluster labels as targets and trained a Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel) to predict the cluster of a new user based on inputs like age, income, marital status, education, and purchase behavior.

Designed a preprocessing pipeline to encode categorical features (e.g., marital status, education) and integrate them seamlessly with numerical features.

Achieved 98% classification accuracy, ensuring high reliability in predicting customer segments.

ðŸ”¹ Business Impact

Automated segmentation enables targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, and better customer retention strategies.

The predictive model empowers businesses to quickly classify new customers into the right segments, improving decision-making and customer experience.
